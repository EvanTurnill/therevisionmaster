This code was created as an exercise to improve my skills as a coder.It is far from perfect and much more functionality could be added, but it has proved useful for learning to write, edit and troubleshoot code. 

I used and adapted some existing code to help me with including: PHPSpreadsheet and fg_membersite.php.

If you want to copy and/or adapt this code, please feel free to download the files. In addition you will need to add the following:

1. A file named database.php in the inc folder with the contents as follows: 

<?php
	$servername = 'myservername';
	$username = 'myusername';
	$password = 'mypassword';
	$dbname = 'mydatabasename';
?>

2. A copy of the the following files need to be added to the include folder with your information added in the relevant places.

fg_membersite.php  [which just needs the secret key part filled in]

and 

membersite_config.php [which needs your relevant database info added].

I have saved these as fg_membersite_to_be_amended.php and membersite_config_to_be_amended.php in this repository.
